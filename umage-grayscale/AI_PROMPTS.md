# AI Usage Policy

This project utilized the following AI tools for code generation and debugging:

- **Cursor** - Used for code generation, debugging, and CSS improvements
- **GPT** - Used for deployment assistance and optimization questions

---

# Key Prompts Used

## 1. Pyodide File Fetch Error (Cursor)

**Prompt:**

```
pyodide Failed to fetch py file with report error:Error: Failed to fetch grayscale.py (404). Tried: assets/py/grayscale.py
```

**Context:** This prompt was used to debug a 404 error when Pyodide attempted to fetch the grayscale.py file from the assets directory.

## 2. CSS Improvements - Glassmorphism Design (Cursor)

**Prompt:**

```
improve css by the follwoing: 1. make Primary Colors: UMass Maroon (#881C1C) and Dark Grey. 2. Style: 'Glassmorphism' aesthetics. Use a frosted glass effect for the cards over a subtle maroon gradient background to make it look less flat/monotonous.  3. Hero Section: A frosted glass card in the center. Inside, use a large, thin-line icon of a camera or upload symbol.
```

**Context:** This prompt was used to enhance the visual design of the application with glassmorphism effects, UMass branding colors, and improved hero section styling.

---

## 3. Directory Structure Tree (Cursor)

**Prompt:**

```
draw a Directory Structure tree under my Project Architecture section of readme
```

**Context:** This prompt was used to generate a visual directory structure tree for the README.md file's Project Architecture section.

---

## 4. GitHub Pages Deployment Issue (GPT)

**Prompt:**

```
I wanna host my web app on GitHub page, and my app is located at a subdirectory named `image-grayscale`. How can I fix it? I currently got 404 error after publish site
```

**Context:** This prompt was used to resolve deployment issues when hosting the web application on GitHub Pages from a subdirectory, addressing 404 errors.

---

## 5. WebView Initialization Performance (GPT)

**Prompt:**

```
The deployment is finished, but I still have to wait a long time for the WebView to initialize. Does this mean I need to wait this long every time I open this website? If so, is this normal? Is there another light package besides OpenCV that can fix this issue?
```

**Context:** This prompt was used to investigate and optimize WebView initialization performance, exploring alternatives to OpenCV for image processing to reduce load times.
